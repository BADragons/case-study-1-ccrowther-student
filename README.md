# WD-CaseStudy
  I will be creating a personal website.
My website will be about my favorite animals and random facts about them.
Some of them will be real animals, 
and some of them are made up. Many drawings will probably be featured.
Some of the animals that will be included are dragons, griffins, tigers, mooshrooms, 
tortioses the size of a football staium, and things that are half one thing like a panda 
and half another thing like an armadillo. 
3 general goals I want to have for my 
website are 1st to be functional, to be organized, and to be really cool and fun. 
My url will be creaturescrambler.com. 
I'm not sure about any other details yet but with all the animals I'll probably need a topical guide.
