# WD-CaseStudy
  I will be creating a personal website.
My website will be about my favorite animals and amazing information about them.
Some of them will be real animals, 
and some of them will be made up. Many drawings will probably be featured.
Some of the animals that will be included are dragons, griffins, tigers, mooshrooms, 
tortioses the size of a football statium, and things that are half one thing like a panda 
and half another thing like an armadillo. 
3 general goals I want to have for my 
website are 1st to be functional, to be organized, and to be really cool and fun. 
Each animal will have it's own page with an illistration and written information about it. 
My url will be creaturescrambler.com. 
I'm not sure about any other details yet but with all the animals I'll probably need a topical guide and lots of links.
