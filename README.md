# WD-CaseStudy
  I will be creating a personal website.
My website will be about my favorite animals and amazing information about them.
Some of them will be real animals, 
and many of them will be made up. Many drawings will probably be featured.
Some of the animals that will be included are dragons, griffins, tigers, mooshrooms, 
tortioses the size of a football statium, and things that are half one thing like a panda 
and half another thing like an armadillo. 
The primary goal and purpose of my website will be to inform people of animals 
and to entain people who want mix things around and make stuff like a snake-sheep or a horse-wolf
3 secondary goals I want to have for my 
website are 1st to be functional, to be organized, and to be really cool and fun. 
Each animal will have it's own page with an illistration and written information about it. 
My url will be creaturescrambler.com. 
of course with all the animals I'll need a topical guide and lots of links. 
People will be able to search for different species and use a DNA scrambler 
thing to see What species you get when you mix them.

                                                                                                                                                                                b. I will use RSS and Discord and get GOOGLE to put my website in thier search list
                                                                                                                                                                                c. put chat boxes and places for comments
                                                                                                                                                                                d. My tagline will be: "ever wondered what what would happen if a bunny rabbit and a baby deer had a baby"
                                                                                                                                                                                e. I plan to make my website as colorful as possible I'm thinking possibly a green foresty look with some other colors.  
                                                                                                                                                                                f. Its basically a glorified dna scrambler. 
When you first come on it looks like a little interactive game. there are two places to type in an animal. 
and an enter button. When you type in the boxes some thing like cat and eagle and press enter, some images will pop up that are labeled 
things like griffin, hippo griff, Nifferg, etc. these are what you would get if you bred a cat and an eagle. That is your mixing station. 
At the top there is a topical guide that has things like home, mixing station, profile, browse, settings, library, comments etc. In browse you can see things that other people bred comment on them, like them, and post your own. 
I hope to include a least 200 different hybrid species. In libary you can see all the hybrids you've made, learn real facts about all the base animals (the cat or the eagle) and see things other people made that you liked and saved to your library. 
in complaints and suggestions you can suggest hybrids and base animals to be added, what to name them, and crazy facts real (or made up for the hybrids.) you can even post pictures and drawings to suggest what they could look like.

 a. Goals: make it funtional, stay on topic, stick the plan, cram it with pictures and drawings and weird facts until you can say that it being an eyesore is an understatement. 
 b. My website's target audience will be weirdos like me who like to "learn about nature and create new things" or to put it simply staring at things and smashing together animals to make horrible monstrosities normal people call hybrids. 
 c. homepage, mixer, library, browse, profile page, complaints/suggestions, settings, desinger.
