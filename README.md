# WD-CaseStudy
  I will be creating a personal website.
My website will be about my favorite animals and amazing information about them.
Some of them will be real animals, 
and many of them will be made up. Many drawings will probably be featured.
Some of the animals that will be included are dragons, griffins, tigers, mooshrooms, 
tortioses the size of a football statium, and things that are half one thing like a panda 
and half another thing like an armadillo. 
The primary goal and purpose of my website will be to inform people of animals 
and to entain people who want mix things around and make stuff like a snake-sheep or a horse-wolf
3 secondary goals I want to have for my 
website are 1st to be functional, to be organized, and to be really cool and fun. 
Each animal will have it's own page with an illistration and written information about it. 
My url will be creaturescrambler.com. 
of course with all the animals I'll need a topical guide and lots of links. 
People will be able to search for different species and use a DNA scrambler 
thing to see What species you get when you mix them.
